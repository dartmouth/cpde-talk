# Reflection on My Semester at the Federation of German-American Clubs Berlin

When I first applied to the Guarini Exchange program in Berlin, I was honestly just looking to improve my German and maybe travel around Europe a bit. As a Government major with a minor in German Studies, it seemed like a logical choice. What I didn't expect was how completely transformative the experience would be, both personally and academically.

The first few weeks were honestly overwhelming. Despite having taken German since freshman year, I struggled to keep up with conversations, especially when Berliners would switch to their local dialect. My host family was patient but didn't slow down for me - which was frustrating at first but turned out to be the best thing for my language development. By week 3, I was dreaming in German, and by mid-semester, I could argue politics with my host dad (who LOVED to debate American foreign policy, especially after a beer or two).

Academically, the program exceeded my expectations. The courses at the Federation were taught by professors who were deeply embedded in German politics and culture. My favorite class, "Migration Politics in Modern Germany," included field trips to government offices and refugee centers that gave me firsthand exposure to how policy affects real people. We met with politicians, activists, and migrants themselves, which complicated all the theoretical frameworks I'd learned at Dartmouth. Nothing in a classroom could have prepared me for sitting across from a Syrian family and hearing their journey to Germany.

The program's structure allowed for independent research, which became the foundation for my senior thesis. I focused on comparing German and American approaches to integrating immigrants into the workforce. The connections I made through the program gave me access to interview subjects and resources I never could have accessed from New Hampshire. My faculty director, Professor Schmidt, connected me with her colleagues at local universities, who further expanded my network.

Living in Berlin itself was an education. The city's complicated history is visible everywhere - from the remaining sections of the Wall to the Holocaust Memorial to the vibrant Turkish neighborhoods. Walking through different parts of the city was like traversing through different historical eras and cultural worlds. I found myself constantly reflecting on how places carry memory and how cities can simultaneously remember traumatic histories while building new identities.

The program wasn't without challenges. The bureaucracy of getting my residence permit was a nightmare (I spent 7 hours in a government office only to be told to come back the next day with a different form). My research hit roadblocks when several interview subjects cancelled. My laptop died mid-semester, and I lost a week's worth of notes before I could get it fixed. And I got terribly sick during a weekend trip to Prague, ending up in a hospital where no one spoke English.

But those challenges were valuable too. I developed resilience and problem-solving skills that no amount of campus life could have taught me. I learned to navigate complex systems in a foreign language, to adapt when things went wrong, and to push through discomfort.

Coming back to campus was harder than I expected. I felt changed in ways that were difficult to articulate to friends who hadn't had similar experiences. My perspectives on American politics had shifted dramatically after seeing alternative approaches to issues like healthcare, education, and immigration. I found myself more critical of systems I had previously taken for granted.

If I could sum up the biggest benefit of the Guarini Exchange, it would be the development of a truly comparative perspective. I no longer see American approaches as the default or norm. I understand that there are multiple valid ways to structure societies and address social challenges. This perspective has made me a more thoughtful student, citizen, and future professional. The program didn't just improve my German or give me material for my thesis - it fundamentally changed how I understand the world and my place in it.
