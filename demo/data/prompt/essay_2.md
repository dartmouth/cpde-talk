# Reflection: My Transformative Term at Williams-Mystic Ocean & Coastal Studies Program

I never thought I'd spend a semester living in a small New England coastal town, learning to sail tall ships and collecting mud samples at 5 AM. As an Environmental Studies major with a focus on policy, I signed up for the Williams-Mystic program primarily because it checked a distribution requirement and seemed like a nice break from Hanover winters. What I got instead was the most challenging, disorienting, and ultimately transformative educational experience of my college career.

The program is structured unlike anything at Dartmouth. Four integrated courses (Marine Policy, Maritime History, Marine Science, and Literature of the Sea) taught by professors who collaborate to create a truly interdisciplinary experience. We weren't just studying the ocean from different angles – we were learning how these perspectives inform and complicate each other. One day we'd analyze 19th century whaling logbooks in the morning, then study whale migration patterns in the afternoon, followed by an evening discussion of international whaling regulations. This holistic approach completely changed how I understand environmental issues.

Field seminars were the heart of the program. Within the first two weeks, we sailed aboard the SSV Corwith Cramer from New Bedford to Mystic, learning to navigate, set sails, and conduct oceanographic research while sleep-deprived and seasick. I threw up four times the first night but still had to take my turn at bow watch at 3 AM in freezing rain. I've never been so miserable – or so proud of myself for pushing through.

Our second field seminar took us to Louisiana's Gulf Coast, where we waded through marshes collecting samples, met with shrimpers whose livelihoods were devastated by hurricanes and oil spills, and interviewed officials from oil companies and environmental agencies. The complexity of the situation was overwhelming. It's easy to vilify the oil industry from a classroom in New Hampshire, but much harder when you're talking to someone whose family has worked on rigs for generations and who sees no economic alternatives.

The Pacific Coast field seminar was equally eye-opening. We studied the impact of dam removal on salmon populations in Washington, met with tribal leaders about indigenous fishing rights, and examined the economic tensions between conservation and resource extraction. One conversation with a third-generation logger who'd lost his job due to spotted owl protections complicated every simple narrative I'd had about environmental conservation.

The program wasn't just academically challenging – it was emotionally and physically demanding too. Living in close quarters with 20 other students meant no privacy and nowhere to hide from interpersonal conflicts. Group projects required late nights and intense collaboration. Field research often meant early mornings, cold water, and physical discomfort. I remember standing in knee-deep mud at 5:30 AM, rain pouring down, trying to collect sediment samples while my fingers went numb – and somehow loving it despite the misery.

The biggest challenge came during our independent research projects. Mine focused on the effectiveness of managed retreat policies in coastal communities facing sea level rise. What looked straightforward on paper became incredibly complex when interviewing residents who were being asked to abandon multi-generational homes. One elderly woman in Mystic showed me photos of her grandchildren playing on a beach that no longer exists and asked, "How do you put a price on that?" I had no answer, and that moment fundamentally changed how I think about climate adaptation policies.

I made mistakes too. During one community meeting about coastal development restrictions, I spoke up with what I thought was an informed opinion, only to be politely but firmly educated by a local fisherman about economic realities I hadn't considered. It was humbling and necessary. I learned that my academic knowledge, while valuable, needed to be balanced with lived experiences and local perspectives.

Coming back to Dartmouth was jarring. Campus concerns that once seemed important now felt trivial. How could I care about dining hall food options when I'd just spent months meeting people whose communities were literally disappearing into the ocean? I struggled to explain my experience to friends who wanted simple stories about sailing adventures rather than complicated reflections on environmental justice.

What I gained from Williams-Mystic was not just knowledge but wisdom. I learned that environmental challenges are never just scientific problems – they're historical, cultural, economic, and deeply personal. I developed research skills that can't be taught in a classroom and the confidence to work through physical and intellectual discomfort. Most importantly, I gained a profound appreciation for the value of multiple perspectives and the humility to recognize the limits of my own understanding.

As I work on my senior thesis and apply to graduate programs in environmental policy, I find myself constantly drawing on this experience. The Guarini Exchange didn't just enhance my education – it redefined what education means to me. It showed me that the most valuable learning happens in the uncomfortable spaces between disciplines, between theory and practice, between certainty and doubt. For that, I will always be grateful.
